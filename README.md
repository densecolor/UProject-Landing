# UProject-Landing

## how to open the project

**Just clone this project from github and open index.html**

## what are the goals of this project

**The goal of this project is to create a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu, which means when you add a new section, the menu can be populated automatically**

## what have learned from that project

**I've learned how to manipulate the DOM: to create elements, to modify the attributes of elements and to listen events like click and scroll**

## what was the struggles that you have faced

**One of the difficulity is to find the threshold value in order to decide when active the section. I used an exact value, it looks right in the normal broswer, but didn't work on ipad or iphone.**

## how did you deal with those struggles

**Then I noticed that I should use some relative height instead of absolute value, so i find the offsetHeight of the element, and it runs well**
